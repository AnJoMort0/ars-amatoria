To help structure possible "dead-end" scenarios where the male character uses manipulative pickup artist (PUA) tactics and encounters various reactions from the girl, here’s how you can implement them based on common PUA strategies and real-life reactions discussed in women's forums and blogs.

### **Dead-Ends Based on PUA Tactics:**

1. **Negging:**
   - **Action:** The male character uses a "neg" like, "You’d be cute if you didn’t wear so much makeup."
   - **Reaction:** The girl initially looks puzzled, but then coldly responds, "I don’t need your approval, and you don’t need to talk to me." She walks away without another word.
   - **Outcome:** A dead-end where the player is left alone, realizing the neg insulted rather than charmed her.

2. **Kino Escalation (Gradual Touching):**
   - **Action:** He lightly touches her arm while talking, escalating to brushing her hair out of her face.
   - **Reaction:** She recoils, visibly uncomfortable, and firmly states, "Don't touch me." Her tone is sharp, and she pulls away, leaving immediately.
   - **Outcome:** Immediate rejection, and the game resets. The attempt at physical escalation backfires as she interprets it as creepy and inappropriate.

3. **Isolation Tactic:**
   - **Action:** He tries to pull her away from her friends with a line like, "Let’s get some air—it’s too loud in here."
   - **Reaction:** The girl hesitates, then says, "I’d rather stay with my friends." Her friends overhear and close in protectively, making it clear he’s not welcome.
   - **Outcome:** A quick dead-end where the group shuts him out, leaving him stuck alone.

4. **Demonstrating Higher Value (DHV):**
   - **Action:** He brags, "I’ve been to five countries this year and run my own business," trying to show off his status.
   - **Reaction:** She rolls her eyes and replies, "Cool story. Does that make you more interesting than the other guys here?"
   - **Outcome:** The character faces an awkward silence before she dismisses him, resulting in another failed attempt due to coming off as arrogant.

5. **False Time Constraint:**
   - **Action:** He says, "I can only talk for a minute, but I just had to meet you," trying to appear casual.
   - **Reaction:** She shrugs indifferently, "Then don’t waste your minute here."
   - **Outcome:** The tactic fails as she calls his bluff, leading to a dead-end and reset where the character realizes his forced nonchalance backfired.

6. **Peacocking (Wearing Outlandish Clothes):**
   - **Action:** He wears flashy, bold clothing like a feathered hat or bright suit to stand out.
   - **Reaction:** She laughs and sarcastically comments, "Wow, subtle. Are you going to a costume party?" before walking off with her friends.
   - **Outcome:** The attempt to draw attention leads to mockery, and the game resets.

7. **Push-Pull Technique:**
   - **Action:** He alternates between showing interest and disinterest, telling her, "You’re kinda cool, but I’m not sure if you’re my type."
   - **Reaction:** She raises an eyebrow, unimpressed, "Why don’t you figure it out and let me know when you do?" before walking away.
   - **Outcome:** The inconsistent approach confuses and irritates her, leading to an immediate rejection and reset.

8. **Spinning Move (Physical Control):**
   - **Action:** He grabs her by the waist and tries to spin her as a playful move.
   - **Reaction:** She forcefully steps back, glaring at him, and says, "Don’t touch me like that."
   - **Outcome:** His overconfidence in physical interaction scares her off, leading to another dead-end.

9. **Qualification Tactic:**
   - **Action:** He tries to make her "qualify" herself with, "What makes you stand out from the other girls here?"
   - **Reaction:** She scoffs, "I don’t need to stand out for you," before leaving.
   - **Outcome:** The attempt to make her seek his approval fails, and the game resets.

10. **Fake Vulnerability:**
    - **Action:** He pretends to be vulnerable, saying something like, "I just don’t think anyone really understands me."
    - **Reaction:** She gives him a blank stare and replies, "Yeah, that’s not my problem."
    - **Outcome:** She dismisses his fake emotional appeal, leading to an awkward exit and reset.

### **What These Dead-Ends Show:**
Each of these dead-ends highlights how manipulative tactics not only fail but actively push the girl away, leading to isolation or awkwardness. These scenarios reinforce the absurdity of PUA strategies and how they ultimately objectify the target rather than build any genuine connection. The reactions from women reflect skepticism, discomfort, or outright rejection, drawn from real-life accounts found on forums and blogs discussing these manipulative techniques【23】【24】.

This structure can help the player experience different dead-ends, each time revealing the futility and harm in following such tactics.

To create endings in *Ars Amatoria* that reinforce how problematic the pick-up artist tactics are, we can combine male character actions based on these techniques with extreme reactions from the female character, showing the escalation of the male’s obsession and moral degradation. This will expose how manipulative behaviors lead to dead ends, further entrenching the player into uncomfortable ethical ground while emphasizing the toxicity of these methods.

### Structuring the Deadends:

**1. The Negging Trap:**
- **Action (Male Character):** After several failed attempts, he follows a common pickup artist trick of giving backhanded compliments, or "negs," like, “You’re cute, but your hair looks better when you put more effort into it.”
- **Reaction (Female Character):** She laughs awkwardly but tries to distance herself. “I don't need your approval.” This leads to a reset, but the next time she responds coldly and shuts him out completely, saying, “You’re a joke. I don’t have time for boys who think putting me down is flirting.”
- **Character's Thought (Male):** "Why the hell isn’t she falling for it? She’s supposed to be insecure now!"
  
**2. The Isolation Attempt:**
- **Action:** The player, guided by advice to isolate the target from her friends (common in the PUA community), tries to separate her by saying, “Let’s get out of here; your friends are holding you back.”
- **Reaction:** Her friends immediately intervene, pulling her away, and she says, “If you think I’m ditching them for you, you’re crazy.” This ends in complete rejection, with her telling him to stay away.
- **Character's Thought:** "Why can’t she see I’m just trying to get her alone? Stupid friends—ruining everything."

**3. The Kino Escalation Disaster:**
- **Action:** The character uses the “kino escalation” technique, slowly ramping up physical contact, like brushing her arm and touching her back without her consent.
- **Reaction:** She recoils and slaps him, yelling, “Don’t touch me! Who the hell do you think you are?” She leaves the scene, possibly triggering a more violent reset if the player continues down this path.
- **Character's Thought:** "She liked it! She’s just pretending. Why do they all pretend they hate it? I need to be more forceful next time."

**4. Peacocking Gone Wrong:**
- **Action:** The male character dresses in a flamboyant outfit, thinking that standing out visually will make him more attractive (a technique known as "peacocking").
- **Reaction:** Instead of being impressed, the girl laughs at him with her friends. “Nice outfit, clown. Are you trying to impress or make me cringe?” This results in a sharp blow to his ego.
- **Character's Thought:** "She’s supposed to be curious, not mocking me. What’s wrong with her?"

**5. The Jealousy Plotline Misfire:**
- **Action:** After trying to make her jealous by mentioning other girls who are interested in him, he says, “I was with someone just like you last week, but you seem more interesting.”
- **Reaction:** She is repulsed, replying, “I’m not here to compete for your attention, creep.” She immediately walks away.
- **Character's Thought:** "Why didn’t she fight for me? She should be begging for my attention!"

**6. Emotional Manipulation (Freeze-Out):**
- **Action:** The character uses the “freeze-out” technique, ignoring her after she doesn’t immediately reciprocate interest, thinking she’ll chase him for attention.
- **Reaction:** Instead of becoming more interested, she tells him off: “You think acting like a child will make me run after you? Get over yourself.”
- **Character's Thought:** "This isn't how it's supposed to go. I was supposed to make her want me more."

### Making the Nasty Behavior Evident:
To ensure the player understands how vile the male character's actions are, the female character’s reactions need to escalate. Her disgust and anger should be exaggerated as she becomes more vocal about the toxicity of the behavior. Meanwhile, the male character spirals into self-justification, confusion, and obsession.

- **Extreme Reactions from the Female Character:** 
  - *“You’re disgusting! Get away from me!”*
  - *“Do you treat all women like toys? You’re pathetic.”*
  - *“I’d rather jump off a cliff than spend one more second near you.”*

This setup ensures the player doesn’t side with the character but instead feels the consequences of manipulation and psychological abuse, leading to discomfort and a moral reckoning.

By blending these toxic actions with such extreme reactions, the game maintains its satirical tone, and players can see the clear consequences of these behaviors without identifying with them on a deeper level【23†source】【24†source】.
